<h1>Eric Brausch</h1>
    <div></div>
<p>Software developer with a background in networking and technical support. In these roles I developed skills including problem diagnosis, independent research, resolution strategy, and learning the value of asking the right questions. An interest in smart home and IOT technologies let me to pursue an online Python course in order to create scripts and automations of my own. Discovering the enormous potential in programming was a game changer and I quickly enrolled at Tech Elevator, a 14-week Java coding bootcamp. After graduation I'll be looking for a position working with a company that prioritizes teamwork, growth, and making a positive impact on the community. </p>
